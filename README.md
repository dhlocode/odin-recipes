# Project Purpose
It's time to put all of the HTML knowledge I've been acquiring so far into practice. In this project,I'm going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won't look very pretty by the time I'm finished.

But that's not the purpose right now. This project is just to build my HTML and git chops. I'll revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
